# Feature-Engineering: Sendy-Logistics
## Background Information 
Logistics in Sub-Saharan Africa increases the cost of manufactured goods by up to
320%; while in Europe, it only accounts for up to 90% of the manufacturing cost. Sendy
is a business-to-business platform established in 2014, to enable businesses of all types
and sizes to transport goods more efficiently across East Africa. The company is
headquartered in Kenya with a team of more than 100 staff, focused on building practical
solutions for Africaâ€™s dynamic transportation needs, from developing apps and web
solutions to providing dedicated support for goods on the move.

## Problem Statement
The purpose of the project is build a model that predicts an accurate delivery time from picking up a package arriving at the final destination.
